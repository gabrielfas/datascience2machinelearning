For those unfamiliar with Ed Sheeran, Ed Sheeran is an english singer, songwriter and producer. [Ed Sheeran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran) has produced grammy award winning singles [Thinking Out Loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA), [Shape of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGwWNGJdvx8) and many more.\n",

    "In the previous section we discovered that Ed Sheeran was the dominant artist of 2017. However, as a budding Data Analyst or Data Scientist, we should always maintain a healthy degree of skepticism towards our initial results. We should always ask additional questions to either validate, invalidate or better understand our results. Some additional questions we might ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What factors could be influencing our results?\n",
    "- Within these factors, which have the highest degree of influence on our results?\n",
    "- How could our initial approach bias our results?\n",

    "Whenever we're performing an analysis, a common influence on our results is **time**. Time often guides our own behavior. We tend to shop more during the month of December compared to August. During winter time, we likely use the heater more. We're also more likely to use the internet during the daytime for work rather than 3am.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset often reflects changes with respect to time. For example, we might conclude that Ed Sheeran was the dominant artist of 2017. However, our results could be heavily influenced by spikes in one or two months:\n",

    "A huge spike in two months, could drastically skew our conclusion. There's a possibility that Spotify users listen to Ed Sheeran more on certain months of the year than others. Perhaps, Ed Sheeran isn't the most popular artist in January to March, but is extremely popular during the summer months. We don't know.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand our results with respect to time, we'll be answering the following question in this mission:\n",
